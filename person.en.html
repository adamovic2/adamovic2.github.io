    <h1> Situating Identities of LGBTIQ migrants from Serbia and Bosnia in Austria</h1>
    <h3> Introducing myself</h3>
    <p> My name is Slađana Adamović. I was born in Carinthia (Austria) and I am currently 24 years old. My parents moved seperately to Austria and met each other in Carinthia.</p>
    <p> Together we often visited my grandparents in Serbia, because after the war they moved from Kosovo and Bosnia to different parts in Serbia. </p>
    <p> I am living in Vienna since 2014 and fell in love with the city. I met a lot of people here and was able to connect in some LGBT communities and to connect with some there too. </p>
    <p> Because of my friends and my diaspora life, I wanted to look deeper in the experiences and stories of LGBTIQ migrants from Serbia and Bosnia in Austria, which for me always seemed to be fallen out of a category. </p>
