    <h3> Introducing myself</h3>
    <p> My name is Slađana Adamović. I was born in Carinthia (Austria) and I am currently 24 years old. My parents moved seperately to Austria and met each other in Carinthia.</p>
    <p> Together we often visited my grandparents in Serbia, because after the Yugoslav war they moved from Kosovo and Bosnia to different parts in Serbia. </p>
    <p> I moved to Vienna 2014 to study cultural and social anthropology at the university of Vienna and I fell in love with the city. Here was able to join LGBTIQ events and visited LGBTIQ organization and connected with some there too. </p>
    <p> Because of my friends and my diaspora life, I wanted to look deeper onto the experiences and stories of LGBTIQ migrants from Serbia and Bosnia in Austria, because it seemed that they always fell out of simple categories. </p>
