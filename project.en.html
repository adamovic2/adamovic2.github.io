    <h1> Situating Identities LGBTIQ migrants from Serbia and Bosnia in Austria</h1>
    <h3> Introducing my research project</h3>
    <p> I want to look at the mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion of lesbian gay, bisexual, transsexual, intersexual and queer (LGBTIQ) migrants in Austria, who fled/migrated from Serbia or Bosnia. I am curious about the way people experience exclusion from and inclusion in communities based on sexual orientation and/or migration.</p> 
    <p> Considering the influences of the EU accession of Serbia has on the discourses and policies on LGBTIQ people from Serbia, I want to look closer at the discourse of LGBT activism in Serbia and Austria. Especially the Belgrade Pride Parade is shaping the national and (concerning the EU) supranational discourse of tolerance of LGBTIQ people in Serbia as well as (but differently) in the diaspora. </p> 
    <p> I want to connect these discourses to specific stereotypes and misconceptions which are still present in Austria about the “Balkan”. Looking into the queer theory, it is significant to emphasize how specific “western” discourses on the topic of sexual orientation are shaping the view, that the “backwarded” “global South” is prohibiting these liberal thoughts. </p> 
    <p> My research question is therefore: </p> 
    <p> <strong> <em> How are LGBTIQ migrants from Serbia and Bosnia situating themselves in Austria and what role do the EU accession policies play in their choice of discursive and material strategies to resist exclusion from LGBTIQ communities?</em></strong></p>
